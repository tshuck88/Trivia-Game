# Trivia-Game

## Introduction
I created this game using JavaScript as a project for my coding bootcamp. Feel free to check it out and leave me any feedback you may have.

## How it works
The user begins the game by click the start button. A question will be displayed and the user will have 30 seconds to choose an answer. After each user answer the game displays whether they got it right or wrong, and then automatically displays a new question after 5 seconds. At the end of the game, the game will display how many answers the user got correct, incorrect, or unanswered.
