# Trivia-Game

## Introduction
I created this game using Bootstap, JavaScript and jQuery as a project for my coding bootcamp. Feel free to check it out and leave me any feedback you may have.

## How it works
The user begins the game by clicking the start button. A question will be displayed and the user will have 30 seconds to choose an answer. After each user answer the game displays whether they got it right or wrong, along with a fun gif of the correct answer. A new question is automatically displayed after 5 seconds. At the end of the game, the game will display how many answers the user got correct, incorrect, or unanswered.
